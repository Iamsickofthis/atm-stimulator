##⚠️ Limitations & Future Improvements

Since this is a beginner-level project, many features are intentionally kept simple.
There are many ways to enhance and improve the project, such as:

Better error handling
(Prevent crashes when entering non-numeric values)

Prevent negative balance withdrawals

Implement an actual mini statement
(Store and display transaction history)

Add multiple users
with their own PINs and accounts

Use a database or file storage
to save account data permanently

Improve the UI/UX
(Clearer menus, better prompts)

Add logging and security improvements

This project is a great foundation for learning, and you can keep building on it step by step.
